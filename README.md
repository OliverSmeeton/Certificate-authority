# Certificate-authority
Files and instructions for generating a Root CA and End Entity certificates for PIV smart cards (e.g: YubiKey) using OpenSSL

Guide:  'UPDATE'

To use custom certificate generation you should make a folder called {Name} containing the openssl config file {cfg}.cnf, within the Certificate-Authority folder, 
where {Name} and {cfg} are the certificate name and config name you will enter into the program at runtime.
